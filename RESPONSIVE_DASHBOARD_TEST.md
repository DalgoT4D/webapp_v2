# Responsive Dashboard Implementation - Test Guide

## What was implemented:

### 1. Responsive Grid Layout
- Replaced `GridLayout` with `ResponsiveGridLayout` from `react-grid-layout`
- Added breakpoints for different screen sizes:
  - **XXS (0-480px)**: Mobile phones - 2 columns
  - **XS (480-768px)**: Large phones - 4 columns  
  - **SM (768-996px)**: Tablets - 6 columns
  - **MD (996-1200px)**: Small laptops - 10 columns
  - **LG (1200px+)**: Desktop - 12 columns

### 2. Automatic Layout Generation
- `generateResponsiveLayouts()` function automatically creates layouts for all breakpoints
- On mobile, components stack vertically with full width
- On larger screens, components scale proportionally

### 3. Responsive Headers
- **Edit Mode**: Mobile header with collapsible rows
  - Top row: Title and essential actions (Save, Preview, Settings)
  - Bottom row: Component actions (Chart, Text, Filter, Undo/Redo)
  - Status row: Lock and save status
- **Preview Mode**: Similar responsive structure
  - Top row: Title with badges
  - Action row: Share, Edit, Delete buttons
  - Metadata row: Author and date info

### 4. Data Persistence
- Dashboard saves responsive layouts to backend
- `responsive_layouts` field added to Dashboard interface
- Backward compatibility with existing dashboards

## Testing Instructions:

### Browser Testing:
1. Open a dashboard in edit mode
2. Resize browser window or use developer tools device simulation
3. Test these breakpoints:
   - 320px (iPhone SE)
   - 768px (iPad)
   - 1024px (laptop)
   - 1200px+ (desktop)

### Expected Behavior:

#### Desktop (1200px+):
- Full toolbar with all buttons and text labels
- 12-column grid with original layout
- All components maintain their positioning

#### Tablet (768-996px):
- Slightly smaller toolbar
- 6-column grid, components scale proportionally
- Text labels still visible

#### Mobile (320-480px):
- Compact mobile header with icon-only buttons
- 2-column grid, components stack vertically
- Horizontal scrolling for action buttons
- Truncated text with proper overflow handling

### File Changes Made:

1. **Dashboard Builder** (`dashboard-builder-v2.tsx`):
   - Responsive header layout
   - ResponsiveGridLayout integration
   - Automatic layout generation

2. **Dashboard Preview** (`dashboard-native-view.tsx`):
   - Mobile-friendly header
   - Responsive grid for viewing

3. **Global Styles** (`globals.css`):
   - Responsive CSS for grid items
   - Mobile-specific adjustments
   - Header typography scaling

4. **Dashboard Interface** (`useDashboards.ts`):
   - Added `responsive_layouts` field
