### 2025-10-13 - Superset-Style Dashboard List Implementation (Phase 1)

#### Implemented Table View for Dashboard List
- **Files Changed**: `components/dashboard/dashboard-list-v2.tsx`
- **Change**: Added Superset-style tabular layout as new default view mode
- **New Features**:
  - Table view with columns: Name (with star), Type, Owner, Last Modified, Actions
  - Sortable columns for Name, Owner, and Last Modified
  - Favorites functionality with star icon toggle
  - Unified actions dropdown with landing page controls
  - Improved visual hierarchy and data organization
- **Technical Details**:

  - Created `renderDashboardTableRow()` function for table layout
  - Updated view mode controls to prioritize table view
  - Enhanced loading states with table-specific skeletons
- **Purpose**: Provide better data density and easier scanning of dashboard information
- **Impact**: Users can now view more dashboards in less space with better sorting and filtering capabilities

#### Fixed JSX Syntax Error in Table Implementation
- **Files Changed**: `components/dashboard/dashboard-list-v2.tsx`
- **Change**: Fixed incorrect JSX parentheses nesting in conditional rendering structure
- **Issue**: Compile error "Unexpected token `div`. Expected jsx identifier" at line 1185
- **Solution**: Corrected ternary operator structure in loading state conditionals (lines 1405-1406)
- **Impact**: Dashboard list now compiles successfully and renders without errors

#### Removed Type Column and Hid Grid View Button
- **Files Changed**: `components/dashboard/dashboard-list-v2.tsx`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Removed Type column from table view (commented out code for future use)
  - Hidden Grid view button while preserving all functionality code
  - Adjusted column widths: Name (50%), Owner (25%), Last Modified (15%), Actions (10%)
  - Updated loading skeleton structure to match new layout
- **Reasoning**: All dashboards are Native type currently, so Type column is redundant
- **Grid View**: Hidden with comment "Commenting Grid view for now. We may use it later when we can figure out thumbnail view for Dashboards"
- **Impact**: Cleaner table layout with more space for dashboard names and better focus on relevant information

#### Implemented Column Filters for Dashboard Table
- **Files Changed**: `components/dashboard/dashboard-list-v2.tsx`
- **New Features Added**:
  - **Name Column Filter**: Text search, favorites toggle, locked/shared status filters
  - **Owner Column Filter**: Multi-select dropdown with search for filtering by dashboard creators
  - **Date Modified Filter**: Quick ranges (Today, Last 7 days, Last 30 days) and custom date range picker
  - **Filter Summary**: Active filter count with "Clear all" option in header
  - **Visual Indicators**: Blue dots on filter icons when active, subtle column highlighting
- **UX Design**:
  - Space-efficient filter icons (ðŸ”½) next to sortable column headers
  - Popover-based filter dropdowns (280px width, auto height)
  - Progressive disclosure: simple options first, advanced features expandable

  - Integrated with existing search and sort functionality
- **Impact**: Users can now efficiently filter dashboards by multiple criteria, making it easier to find specific dashboards in large datasets

#### Fixed Runtime Initialization Error in Column Filters
- **Files Changed**: `components/dashboard/dashboard-list-v2.tsx`
- **Issue**: Runtime error "Cannot access 'applyColumnFilters' before initialization"
- **Root Cause**: Function was being called before it was defined in the component scope
- **Solution**: 
  - Converted filtering logic to `useMemo` for better performance and proper initialization order
  - Integrated filtering and sorting into single memoized computation
  - Added proper dependency array to ensure updates when filter state changes
- **Performance Improvement**: Filtering and sorting now only recalculate when relevant state changes
- **Impact**: Column filters now work correctly without runtime errors, with improved performance

#### Fixed Owner Filter Dropdown - Grayed Out Email Selection Issue
- **Files Changed**: `components/dashboard/dashboard-list-v2.tsx`
- **Issue**: Owner emails appeared grayed out and unselectable in the filter dropdown
- **Root Cause**: Command component from shadcn/ui was causing styling conflicts and interaction issues
- **Solution**: 
  - Replaced Command component with simpler, more reliable checkbox list

#### Fixed React Hooks Order Violation in Owner Filter
- **Files Changed**: `components/dashboard/dashboard-list-v2.tsx`
- **Issue**: Runtime error "React has detected a change in the order of Hooks called by DashboardListV2"
- **Root Cause**: `useState` hook was being called inside `renderOwnerFilter` function, violating Rules of Hooks
- **Solution**:
  - Moved `ownerSearch` useState to component's top level (line 125)
  - Extracted `filteredOwners` calculation to component level with useMemo
  - Added proper dependency array `[uniqueOwners, ownerSearch]` for memoization
  - Removed hook call from nested function
- **React Best Practices**: Now follows Rules of Hooks by calling all hooks at top level consistently
- **Performance**: Added memoization to owner filtering to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- **Impact**: Fixed runtime React error and improved component stability and performance

#### Hidden Search Bar and View Mode Controls - Streamlined UI
- **Files Changed**: `components/dashboard/dashboard-list-v2.tsx`
- **Changes Made**:

- **Reasoning**: 
  - Column filters provide more precise search functionality than global search
  - Table view is the only supported view (grid view commented out for future use)
  - Simplified UI reduces cognitive load and focuses on column-based filtering
- **UI Impact**:
  - Cleaner header area with only filter summary when active
  - Filter summary now takes full width when filters are applied
  - Removed redundant search functionality in favor of column-specific filters

  - **Tightened Title Section**: Changed bottom margin from `mb-6` to `mb-3` (reduced from 24px to 12px)
  - **Conditional Filter Summary**: Filter summary only shows when active (saves space when no filters applied)
  - **Cleaned JSX Structure**: Removed all commented code blocks that were causing syntax issues
- **Visual Impact**:
  - **Less Whitespace**: Eliminated excessive spacing below dashboard title
  - **Better Proportions**: More balanced header-to-content ratio

  - **Actions Column**: Unchanged at 10% (sufficient for action buttons)
- **Consistency Updates**: 
  - Updated loading skeleton column widths to match new proportions
  - Maintained all functionality while improving visual balance
- **Design Rationale**:
  - **Better Color Harmony**: Teal/green theme creates cohesive design with teal buttons (#06887b)
  - **Improved Readability**: Dark gray text with teal hover provides better contrast
  - **Balanced Layout**: 40/35/15/10 ratio provides optimal space distribution
- **Impact**: More harmonious color scheme and better column proportions that improve both aesthetics and usability
